The above codes are for the paper "Synthesis of V-count-optimal quantum circuits for multi-qubit unitaries", by Priyanka Mukhopadhyay. The implementations are in Python.

Exact_V_opt.py : This is the code for synthesizing exactly implementable unitaries, using generating set Clifford+G_{Cliff}^{(2)}. It implements EXACT-V-OPT and its sub-routines. RANDOM-CHAN-REP is also implemented here.

Exact_V2_opt.py : This is the code for synthesizing exactly implementable unitaries, using generating set $\mathcal{G}_4$. It implements EXACT-V-OPT and its sub-routines. RANDOM-CHAN-REP is also implemented here.

Approx_V_opt.py : This is the code for synthesizing approximately implementable unitaries, using generating set Clifford+G_{Cliff}^{(2)}.. It implements APPROX-V-OPT and its sub-routines.
